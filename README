= ltprotocol =

LTProtocol is a Twisted library extension written in Python. It provides a
Twisted-based client and server implementation for protocols which begin with a
length and type field.

Create your protocol by constructing an LTProtocol with a list of LTMessage
objects which specify your protocol.  Use LTTwistedServer and LTTwistedClient to
create a server or client.  You may wish to subclass these classes in order to
take custom actions when a client connects or disconnects.
